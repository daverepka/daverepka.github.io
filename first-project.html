      <h1>Welcome to David Repka's Portfolio!</h1>
        <h2> Intro </h2>
        <p> My name is David Repka and I am from Hockessin, DE. Coming from a small town in a small state truly opened my eyes to all the opportunities that are in this world. I used these opportunnnities to help bolster my talents within photography, and I hope that you enjoy my art.</p>
        <h2> Miami </h2>
        <p> Here is where I will compile photographs that I have taken in the Miami area. I have lived in South Miami for about 5 years and have beenn using that time to explore and take portraits around the area</p>
        <h2> New York </h2>
        <p> I have been working for a start up Italian purse brand based out of Manhatten New York. It has given me a multitude of opportunities to continue my craft while helping build a company. </p>
